## 📝 Overview
This repository is for the **Mushroom Classification** project, where the objective is to classify mushrooms as **poisonous** or **edible** based on various mushroom attributes. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and training a classification model.

## 📁 Mushroom Dataset
You can find the dataset used for this project on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom).
